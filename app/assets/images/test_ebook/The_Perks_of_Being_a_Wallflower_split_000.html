Again and again throughout the book he exhibits pure wisdom we all like to read about and witness. And Stephen Chbosky doesn’t let us down. The language is plain and springy and blunt… In this culture where adolescence is a dirty word, I hope nothing bad ever happens to this [protagonist].”</p><p class="calibre5">—<span class="italic">LA Times</span></p><p class="calibre4">“Charlie, his friends and family are palpably real… [he] develops from an observant wallflower into his own man of action.… This report on his life will engage teen readers for years to come.”</p><p class="calibre5">—<span class="italic">School Library Journal</span>, starred review</p><p class="calibre4">“Chbosky captures adolescent angst, confusion, and joy as Charlie reveals his innermost thoughts while trying to discover who he is and whom he is to become. Intellectually precocious, Charlie[’s]… reflections… are compelling. He vacillates between full involvement in the crazy course of his life and backing off completely. Charlie is a likeable kid whose humor-laced trials and tribulations will please both adults and teens.”</p><p class="calibre5">—<span class="italic">Booklist</span></p><p class="calibre4">“Chbosky adds an upbeat ending to a tale of teenaged angst—the right combination of realism and uplift to allow it on high school reading lists.… [The protagonist] oozes with sincerity, rails against celebrity phoniness, and feels an extraliterary bond with his favorite writers (Harper Lee, Fitzgerald, Kerouac, Ayn Rand, etc.)… A plain-written narrative suggesting passivity, and thinking too much, lead to confusion and anxiety.”</p><p class="calibre5">—<span class="italic">Kirkus</span></p><p class="calibre2"><span class="bold">An Amazon.com #1 Young Adult Bestseller</span></p><p class="calibre3" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre3" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><div class="mbppagebreak" id="calibre_pb_1"></div></body></html>
